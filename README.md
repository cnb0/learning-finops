### Course Overview 

- Introduction to FinOps for Engineers
- Benefits of Cost Efficiency for Engineers
- FinOps Persona Motivations
- Building a Common Language
- Responsibilities of Engineers
- Cost Efficiency Responsibilities
- Optimizing Usage Function Responsibilities
- Aligning Responsibilities with Related Functions in Business
- Responsibilities in Cloud Adoption Support and FinOps Rollout

## Prerequisites

- Understand the basics of how cloud computing works, know the key 
  services on your cloud providers, including their common use cases
- basic understanding of billing and pricing models.
- Be able to describe the basic value proposition of running in cloud & 
   understand the core concept of using a pay-as-you-go consumption model.
- Have a base level of knowledge of at least one of the three main 
  public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). For AWS


## Objectives 

1.Describe 

    - what FinOps or Cloud Financial Management is, and why it is necessary
    - how FinOps relates to other software engineering methodologies/disciplines
    - The basic function and goals of a FinOps team
    - The motivations and drivers of finance, product, business and management 
      teams with respect to FinOps and compare them to engineering and operations 
      groups’ motivations
    
2.Understand 

    - The basic financial concepts and why they are important to the business
    - The fundamental capabilities and functions needed to manage public cloud 
      cost & usage

3.Describe the responsibilities of engineering and operations team members in 
  the performance of those functions

4.Enumerate how the engineer’s job has changed from on-premises traditional IT 
  to cloud

5.Explain 

     - strategies engineers can take to integrate cost awareness into architecture, 
       design,build and operate processes
     - strategies for engineering and operations teams to better integrate with other 
       functional groups to derive more value from public cloud use
