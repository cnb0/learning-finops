```

## Objectives :
```
1.Describe 
    - what FinOps or Cloud Financial Management is, and why it is necessary
    - how FinOps relates to other software engineering methodologies/disciplines
    - The basic function and goals of a FinOps team
    - The motivations and drivers of finance, product, business and management 
      teams with respect to FinOps and compare them to engineering and operations 
      groups’ motivations
    
3.Understand 
    - The basic financial concepts and why they are important to the business
    - The fundamental capabilities and functions needed to manage public cloud 
      cost & usage

4.Describe the responsibilities of engineering and operations team members in 
      the performance of those functions

5.Enumerate how the engineer’s job has changed from on-premises traditional IT 
  to cloud

6.Explain 
     - strategies engineers can take to integrate cost awareness into architecture, 
       design, build and operate processes
     - strategies for engineering and operations teams to better integrate with
       other functional groups to derive more value from public cloud use
